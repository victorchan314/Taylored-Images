# Taylored Images

Basic extension that replaces all images on a webpage with pictures of Taylor Swift.

The extension will run every time you travel to a new page or click the browser action. However, if you simply run some javascript on a page (such as searching on Google without refreshing or clicking a button that performs an action) that reveals new mentions of UC Berkeley, the extension will not detect those changes.
